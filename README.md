# dond-api
This Flask API receives JSON game data from the JS Deal or No Deal game (in my js-borrowed-dond repo) and saves it to a text file in my Google Cloud Storage through concatenation by making use of the google bucket "blobs."

This repo was git cloned into a folder in the Google Cloud Shell and deployed using gcloud app deploy.
